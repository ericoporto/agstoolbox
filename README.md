Utility software to help manage, install, and uninstall different AGS Editor versions

_inspired by [JetBrains Toolbox](https://www.jetbrains.com/toolbox-app/), but different_

⚠**under construction**⚠

Desired features:

- Download any archive.zip of any AGS version from 3.5.0 forward
- buttons for launching Editor or opening folder in windows explorer
- monitoring new releases
- check download integrity with some hashing
- allow setting a default AGS to use
- allow removing a downloaded Editor from hard drive
- launching online AGS manual
- detect AGS editors installed through other means (but not manage them)
